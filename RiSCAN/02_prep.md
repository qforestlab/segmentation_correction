# Overview

We’re preparing our individual tree point clouds for segmentation by:

- Importing all point clouds into RiSCAN PRO with the correct CRS  
- Generating crown‐hull shapefiles for each tree  
- Configuring the shapefile in QGIS for manual segmentation

# Methods

## 1. Import Point Clouds into RiSCAN PRO

### 1.a Create a New Project

1. Open **RiSCAN PRO** and click **New Project**.  
   ![Create new project](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/047abe2c-e552-45ec-9283-60cea157a84c)  
2. Save the project **locally** under a descriptive name.  
   ![Save project](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5c60b46-2ea7-4a8c-9e5d-451cb18ab3d9)

### 1.b Set the Coordinate Reference System

1. In the project manager, select your project name.  
2. Navigate to **Edit → Attributes → Coordinate Reference Systems**.  
3. In the GeoSysManager database, open **NQLD.gfx** and confirm. (You can find the NQLD.gfx file on the australia shares (called `qfl_australia_tls`), if you are working on a different region and using this manual as a guide, make a `.gfx` file for your own UTM Zone by following the steps [here](https://github.com/qforestlab/riscan_registration/blob/main/1.GeoSysManager.md).)
   ![Open NQLD.gfx](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b094947c-3642-48bc-86ea-2c8c7ddf38f4)  
4. Apply these settings:

### 1.c Import the Point Clouds

1. Right‑click **Objects → Point Clouds** and choose **Import**.  
2. Select all individual tree point clouds in the **selected_trees folder** and import them with the "Combine files" toggled off. Also import the **leftover** point cloud to be found in the Propagation folder with a name formatted like this: `2024-08-14_ep31_woopen_creek_ds1cm_20mbuffer_propagated.las`. And finally, import the trees that are outside the 40x90m AOI, to be found in the folder **trees_outside**, for these trees make sure to **toggle ON "Combine files"!** (The point clouds can be found on the qfl_australia_tls shares)

3. Set CRS to **WGS 84 / UTM zone 55 S** (or a different UTM zone, if not Australia), and **disable** “Combine files.”

> **Tip:** While the import runs (which can take several minutes), move on to step 2.

## Additional Step - CHECK IF YOUR POINTCLOUDS WERE FILTERED
Due to small issue, some of the pointclouds we are working with for the australia project, had the filtering undone.
Please make sure to check if all pointclouds are filtered by following the next steps:

1. Open (some of) your pointclouds in the viewer and colour them by reflectance. Set the min/max values to -20 and 5dB. Make the colour gradient grayscale and the color below/above bright colours. Click OK.

2. If your pointclouds are unfiltered, there will be colours in the pointcloud. eg green

## 2. Generate Crown‐Hull Map of Individual Trees

### 2.a Create the Shapefile

1. Open `Get-shape-file-crowns.Rmd` (In this repo at [link](https://github.com/qforestlab/segmentation_correction/blob/main/get_crown_shape.Rmd) or on the qfl_australia_tls shares, under the folder "scripts").  
2. Update the folder paths to point at the individual‐tree point‐cloud directory (make sure the full plot point cloud is not in the same folder).  
3. Run the RMarkdown in RStudio to produce a shapefile of each tree’s crown hull.

### 2.b Configure the Shapefile in QGIS

1. Open the new shapefile in **QGIS**.  
2. Set the layer CRS to **WGS 84 / UTM zone 55 S** (or a different UTM zone, if not Australia).  
   ![Layer CRS](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94a60f0b-de5d-492d-b1c6-e26bc2833be7)

#### 2.b.i Add a “Segmented” Field

1. Open the **Attribute Table**, click **Edit** (pencil symbol), then **Add Field**.  
2. Name the field `Segmented` and choose **Boolean**. 
   
   Some versions of QGIS do not have the option Boolean (see screenshot). In that case, work with an integer and use 0 and 1 for false and true.

3. Also add a field `Notes` and choose **Text** as the type.
4. Save edits and exit editing mode by clicking the pencil symbol again.
   ![Add Segmented field](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7463e8b3-0818-434f-8d9d-39df96e7b14a)  
   ![Field values](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de5a331c-5d9e-4a6f-bfab-dcfe368c6544)

#### 2.b.ii Style by Segmentation Status

1. In **Layer Properties → Symbology**, choose **Categorized** and select the `Segmented` field.  
2. Click **Classify**, then assign **False/NULL** to red and **True** to green. Set opacity to 50%.  
   ![Symbology settings](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a4f6498-9f6c-497a-8a09-9b500c3dbdce)  
   ![Interim view](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b4051b5-b756-4c28-9885-7c6b333409b5)

#### 2.b.iii Label Trees for Easy Identification

1. In **Layer Properties → Labels**, enable labeling by tree ID.  
2. Adjust font size and placement so labels are legible.  
   ![Label settings](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/875acf6d-3ded-4fba-8815-6fe6a6d5792b)

You now have a clear top‐down view where each tree is color‑coded by segmentation status and with it's name as label. As you segment a tree, toggle its `Segmented` attribute to **True** to update its color (make sure edit is toggled on as well).
