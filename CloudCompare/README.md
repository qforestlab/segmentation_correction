# Overview

This manual will guide you through the segmentation of tree point clouds in Cloud Compare. It is designed for use after automated segmentation resulting in two parts: individual tree point clouds, and the 'remainder' point cloud. However, the general method of segmenting in Cloud Compare can be applied to any point clouds. There is demo data supplied that was used to create this manual, accessible if you would like to follow along. Additionally, there are 'corrected' files as examples of the desired result.

This tutorial is broken into two main steps:
1. CloudCompare overview and project set up
2. Segment/merge/save
